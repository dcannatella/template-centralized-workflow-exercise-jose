# Gnocci al pesto

## Ingredients (for 4 pp.):
- fresh basil
- pine nuts
- parmesan
- garlic
- olive oil
- Gnocchi!

## Procedure:
Step 1:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Meanwhile, make the pesto by adding all ingredients to a bowl and blitz with an immersion blender to a smooth saucy consistency.

Step2:
Cook the gnocchi according to packet instructions or until they float to the top of the water (reserve a little cooking water).

Step3:
Drain the gnocchi once cooked and add back to the pot. Add the pesto sauce and stir until thoroughly coated. Serve with extra parmesan cheese.

et voila'!

## Variations to try
### Add a spicy kick
Add a sprinkling of red pepper flakes either on top of the pesto gnocchi or into the basil pesto itself. We often had a little chilli in our pesto dishes in Italy and it's such a delicious addition.
### Make it creamy
You can mix the pesto with ricotta to make a super creamy and delicious pesto sauce. You'll need some reserved cooking water to thin the sauce slightly if it's too thick.
### Add veggies
You could add in extra veggies such as cooked bell peppers, zucchini, broccoli or spinach.
